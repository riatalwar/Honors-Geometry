"""
Program Summary:
This program will take a list of triangle measures for triangle ABC - side lenghts (a,b,c)
followed by angle measures (A,B,C) - and display these in a user-friendly format.

##INPUT

# Leave this blank...(nothing to do here)


##PROCESSING

SideAngleMeasures = [3.6, 2.0, 5.1, 33.30240516500015, 17.76009924291366, 128.93749559208618]


##OUTPUT

Results for your triangle ABC:
a = 3.6, b = 2.0, c = 5.1
A = 33.3, B = 17.76, C = 128.94

(1) all output values must be rounded to 2 decimal places; and
(2) the output needs to match exactly (every character matters)
